## 17/12/2024

- Data prep: update to extract CAD as well 
- SNP prep: rerun to increase sample size for CAD
- GLM: test SNP effects in my groups (men, women, post-menopausal only, pre-menopausal only)
- MVMR: rerun all test with updated 1-sample data

## 12/12/2024

- GAMLSS (main and no slope model)
- MVMR
- some plots (Forest plot, genetic correlation heatmap for coloc data set only)

## 06/12/2024

- Data prep complete: 
    - Samples filtered as before
    - pre- and post-menopausal status added
    - non-genetic models run: age has a negative effect in men and post-menopausal women, but a positive one in pre-menopausal women (and women)
- SNP prep complete: 
    - Candidate SNPs per sex
    - Coloc to check for overlapping loci (for approach using same SNPs only)
- To Do next week: 
    - run GAMLSS
    - run MVMR
    - make plots
